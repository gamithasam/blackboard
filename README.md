  <em>Blackboard AI - Educational content creation with AI, Manim, and TTS</em>
</p>

> **üöß Project Status: In Active Development**  
> Blackboard AI is currently under active development. While core functionality is working, features are being refined and new capabilities are being added regularly. Expect frequent updates and improvements!

**Blackboard AI** is an innovative educational content creation tool that automatically generates narrated mathematical videos using the power of AI. By combining OpenAI's ChatGPT, Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine), and advanced Text-to-Speech technology, Blackboard AI transforms educational concepts into engaging visual explanations.

## ‚ú® Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to create educational scripts and mathematical explanations
- üìä **Mathematical Animations**: Uses Manim to generate beautiful, precise mathematical visualizations
- üéôÔ∏è **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Converts generated scripts into natural-sounding narration
- üé¨ **Automated Video Production**: Seamlessly combines animations with voiceover to create complete educational videos
- üñ•Ô∏è **macOS Desktop App**: Native macOS application with intuitive user interface
- üìö **Educational Focus**: Specifically designed for mathematical and scientific content creation

## üöÄ Getting Started

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Development Notice**  
> This project is currently in development. Installation and setup processes may change as the project evolves. Check back for updates and stable releases.

### Prerequisites

- macOS (for the desktop app)
- Xcode (for development)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation (Development Version)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blackboard.git
   cd blackboard
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open "Blackboard AI/Blackboard AI.xcodeproj"
   ```

3. **Set up your OpenAI API key**
   - Run the application from Xcode
   - Go to Settings within the app
   - Add your OpenAI API key

4. **Build and run**
   - Use Xcode to build and run the application

### üì¶ Releases

**Coming Soon!** I'm working on packaging Blackboard AI for easier installation:
- macOS App Bundle (.app) - *In Development* (will include Python environment)
- Web Application - *Planned* (after Aether framework development)
- Windows Executable - *Planned* (after Aether framework development)

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Input Your Topic**: Provide a mathematical concept or educational topic you want to explain
2. **AI Script Generation**: ChatGPT generates a comprehensive script with mathematical explanations
3. **Animation Creation**: Manim creates corresponding visual animations and mathematical diagrams
4. **Voice Synthesis**: Text-to-Speech converts the script into natural narration
5. **Video Assembly**: All components are automatically combined into a final educational video

## Ô∏è Core Components

### Engine.py
The heart of Blackboard AI that orchestrates:
- AI content generation and prompt management
- Manim scene creation and rendering
- Text-to-Speech processing
- Video compilation pipeline

### OpenAI.swift
