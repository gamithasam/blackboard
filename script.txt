The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry.
It applies only to right-angled triangles.
According to the theorem, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
Let's draw a right triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5.
Now, we build a square on each side of the triangle.
Observe that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the other two squares.
This confirms the Pythagorean Theorem visually.
